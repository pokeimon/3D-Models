I love the Prusa i3 mk3, it is nearly silent that I don't mind having it in the room 
with me while I sleep but the LCD is too bright so I decided to design and print a simple cover 
that I can place on the screen that blocks out all visible light.

Plus it can act as a dust cover when the printer is not in use.
